# Business Intelligence Architecture Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Business Intelligence architecture implemented in this project. It covers the data warehouse design, ETL processes, OLAP cubes, and reporting solutions.

## Data Warehouse Architecture

### Star Schema Design

The data warehouse follows a star schema design with the following components:

- **Fact Tables**: Central tables containing business metrics
  - FactSales: Sales transactions
  - FactInventory: Inventory levels

- **Dimension Tables**: Descriptive attributes
  - DimDate: Time dimension
  - DimCustomer: Customer attributes
  - DimProduct: Product attributes

### Slowly Changing Dimensions

The data warehouse implements Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) for:

- Customer dimension (tracking changes in customer segments)
- Product dimension (tracking changes in product categories and prices)

## ETL Pipeline

### Data Sources

- Operational databases (SQL Server)
- CRM systems (API)
- Flat files (CSV, Excel)

### ETL Process

1. **Extraction**: Data is extracted from source systems
2. **Transformation**: Data is cleansed, transformed, and conformed
3. **Loading**: Data is loaded into the data warehouse

### Scheduling

- Full loads: Weekly (weekends)
- Incremental loads: Daily (overnight)

## OLAP Cubes

### Cube Design

- Sales Analysis Cube
- Inventory Analysis Cube
- Financial Analysis Cube

### Hierarchies

- Time: Year > Quarter > Month > Day
- Geography: Country > Region > City
- Product: Category > Subcategory > Product

## Security Model

- Role-based access control

- Partitioning
- Indexing strategies
- Query optimization

## Maintenance Procedures

- Backup and recovery
- Monitoring
- Troubleshooting
