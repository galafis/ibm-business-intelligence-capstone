# ETL Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines the best practices for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes implemented in this project.

## Extraction

### Source System Considerations

- **Minimize Impact**: Schedule extractions during off-peak hours
- **Incremental Extraction**: Use change data capture (CDC) when available
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for source system unavailability

### Data Profiling

- Profile source data before designing transformations
- Identify data quality issues early
- Document data lineage

## Transformation

### Data Cleansing

- Handle missing values appropriately
- Standardize formats (dates, phone numbers, addresses)
- Remove duplicates
- Validate against business rules

### Data Conformity

- Ensure consistent naming conventions
- Apply standard codes and hierarchies
- Resolve conflicts between source systems

### Performance Considerations

- Process data in batches
- Use set-based operations instead of row-by-row processing
- Consider parallel processing for large datasets

## Loading

### Loading Strategies

- **Full Load**: Complete replacement of target data
- **Incremental Load**: Adding only new or changed records
- **Merge Load**: Updating existing records and adding new ones

### Slowly Changing Dimensions

- Type 1: Overwrite the old value
- Type 2: Add a new record with the current value
- Type 3: Add a new attribute to preserve history

### Transaction Management

- Use transactions to ensure data integrity
- Implement proper error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Log all load operations

## Monitoring and Logging

### ETL Logging

- Log start and end times
- Track record counts (extracted, transformed, loaded)
- Record errors and warnings
- Monitor performance metrics

### Alerting

- Set up alerts for failed jobs
- Monitor for data quality issues
- Track performance degradation

## Testing

### Test Types

- Unit testing for individual transformations
- Integration testing for the entire ETL process
- Regression testing after changes

### Test Data

- Create representative test datasets
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Validate results against expected outcomes

## Documentation

### Process Documentation

- Document the overall ETL architecture
- Detail each ETL job and its components
- Maintain data lineage documentation

### Metadata Management

- Track source-to-target mappings
- Document business rules and transformations
- Maintain a data dictionary

## Scheduling and Orchestration

### Job Dependencies

- Define clear job dependencies
- Implement proper error handling for dependent jobs
- Consider parallel execution where possible

### Monitoring

- Monitor job execution times
- Track resource utilization
- Set up alerts for job failures

## Error Handling

### Error Types

- Source system unavailability
- Data quality issues
- Transformation errors
- Loading failures

### Recovery Strategies

- Implement retry logic
- Provide clear error messages
- Document recovery procedures
